a4d-vim-syntax
==============

Syntax highlighting for active 4D files in vim.

Next Steps
----------

* Treat multi-word commands as a unit
* Handle html
* Indentation file
* Active 4D specific commands

Source Files

For convenience I've included what I'm using as a comprehensive list of 4D commands
(not-including active 4D commands) and a list of the distinct words in those
commands.
